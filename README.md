## Introduction
Breast cancer, affecting 2.3 million women globally in 2020, remains a significant health concern. Despite advancements in early detection therapies leading to an impressive 99% survival rate, challenges persist in the automatic segmentation of tumors using breast ultrasound. Tumors exhibit variations in size and shape, presenting a hurdle for accurate identification. Additionally, the presence of irregular and ambiguous boundaries in these tumors further complicates the segmentation process. The frequently low signal-to-noise ratios within breast ultrasound images add another layer of difficulty, making it challenging to distinguish tumors from background noise. Our project tackles these challenges head-on by leveraging an encoder-decoder model, with the goal of enhancing the precision and efficiency of breast cancer detection through sophisticated computational approaches.
